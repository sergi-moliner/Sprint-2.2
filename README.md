# Sprint 2 IT Academy | Shop

## Introduction

This project is a simple web application developed as part of the Sprint 2 assignment for IT Academy. The objective is to create a demo version of an e-commerce platform that allows users to manage a shopping cart and apply promotions to their purchases.

<br>

## Project Overview

As requested by the client, this initial demo version focuses on implementing the core functionalities of managing the shopping cart and applying promotions. The project utilizes hard-coded data within the application, avoiding the need for server-side API consumption at this stage. The logic for managing products, cart, and checkout process is implemented primarily in two JavaScript files: shop.js and checkout.js.

git clone https://github.com/sergi-moliner/Sprint-2.2/
```
2. Navigate to the project directory.

3. Open the project in your preferred code editor.

4. Start a local development server or open the index.html file in a web browser to view the application.

## Files and Directories

-index.html: Main shopping page where users can browse and add products to their cart.
-checkout.html: Checkout page where users review their cart and complete their purchase.
-css/: Directory containing CSS stylesheets for styling the HTML pages.
